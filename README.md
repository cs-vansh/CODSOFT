# CodSoft Java Development

This repository contains implementations of three Java programming tasks aimed at enhancing fundamental programming skills and understanding of object-oriented principles. Each task serves as a practical exercise in applying Java programming concepts, including user input handling, logic implementation, and interface design.

## Task 1: Number Guessing Game

- **Objective**: Create a number guessing game where the user guesses a randomly generated number within a specified range.
- **Implementation**:
  - Java program utilizes `Random` class for number generation and `Scanner` class for user input.
  - Feedback is provided to the user on whether their guess is correct, too high, or too low.
  - Option for multiple rounds and tracking of user score is included.
  
## Task 2: Student Grade Calculator

- **Objective**: Develop a program to calculate total marks, average percentage, and assign grades based on the average percentage obtained by a student.
- **Implementation**:
  - Java program accepts marks obtained in each subject and calculates total marks and average percentage.
  - Grades are assigned based on predefined percentage ranges.
  - User-friendly input validation ensures marks are within the acceptable range.

## Task 3: ATM Machine Simulation

- **Objective**: Simulate an ATM interface enabling withdrawals, deposits, balance checks, and mini statement viewing.
- **Implementation**:
  - Utilizes Java Swing for user interface design.
  - Manages account balances and transaction histories seamlessly.
  - Offers intuitive options for banking operations with relevant feedback messages.
